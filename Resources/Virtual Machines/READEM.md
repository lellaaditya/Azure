Azure virtual machines are one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers

Azure virtual machines can be used in various ways. Some examples are:

**Development and test** – Azure virtual machines offer a quick and easy way to create a computer with specific configurations required to code and test an application.

**Applications in the cloud** – Because demand for your application can fluctuate, it might make economic sense to run it on a virtual machine in Azure. You pay for extra virtual machines when you need them and shut them down when you don’t.

**Extended datacenter** – virtual machines in an Azure virtual network can easily be connected to your organization’s network.

The number of virtual machines that your application uses can scale up and out to whatever is required to meet your needs

**Things to consider before creating**

names

location where the resources are stored

size of the virtual machine

maximum number of virtual machines that can be created

operating system that the virtual machine runs

configuration of the virtual machine after it starts

related resources that the virtual machine needs
